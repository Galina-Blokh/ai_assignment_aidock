Deal with imbalanced data
# TODO 1. Increase the data set at all
# TODO 2. Try to add weights into model_train.py, using glob,BERT,NLTK,Spacy
# D0NE 3. Bad idea - underfit: Add more features such as have_adjective, count_adjectives
# TODO 4. I don't believe it won't be overfit - Try Over Sampling and Data augmentation
# TODO 5. Try to translate the given sentence to ‘non-English’ language and then again translating to ‘English’.
# TODO 6. Find how to concatenate 2 embeddings with different dimensions
# DONE 7.  Add l2 regularization/removed
# TODO 8. Do sharp and lime model explanation OR JUST FEATURE IMPORTANCE/TENSORBOARD

Tune the model
# TODO 1. Try HYPEROPT to tune the model (maybe it will better work with tensorflow than with scikitlearn)
# TODO 2. Write out to dict model's hyperparameters and tune automatically
# TODO 3. Add  kfold validation

Code changes
# DONE 1. Change in for_one_link_run.py df['text'] to show real text, not cleaned
# DONE 2. Do something with project architecture
