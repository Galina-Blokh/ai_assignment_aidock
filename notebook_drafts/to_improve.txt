Deal with imbalanced data
1. Increase the data set at all
2. Try to add weights into model_train.py, using glob,BERT,NLTK,Spacy
3. Add more features such as TFIdF,  have_adjective, count_adjectives
4. Try Over Sampling and Data augmentation
5. Try to translate the given sentence to ‘non-English’ language and then again translating to ‘English’.

Tune the model
1. Try HYPEROPT to tune the model (maybe it will better work with tensorflow than with scikitlearn)
2. Write out to dict model's hyperparameters and tune automatically in model_preprocess/list_dir.py

Code changes
1. Change in for_one_link_run.py df['text'] to show real text, not cleaned
